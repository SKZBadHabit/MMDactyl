## Coding

Code under development - test of components, like layers and other movements (mouse,...)

## Lasercut

Files for lasering flatpack of Dactyl, fully functioning files but not pretty for now

## Next Steps

  - implement to one of the already existing keyboards (exchange the Arduino pro micro)
  - fit code to keyboard
  - test till nothing moves anymore
  - add complications display (weather, status keyboard,...)
  - add website to rp2040w to change/show settings
  - cleanup lasercut files
  - functionallity of keyboard in bios (without os)
