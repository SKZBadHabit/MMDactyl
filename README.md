###

Adding a plan for cabeling and set up

## Coding

Code under development - test of components, like layers and other movements (mouse,...)

### Status of code

it is currently under development but fully functional V3.03 contains layer 1 and 2 and basic functionallity of the display, with bios support and without hibernation/energy saving - no wireless function


## Lasercut

Files for lasering flatpack of Dactyl, fully functioning files but not pretty for now


## Done Steps

  - implement to one of the already existing keyboards (exchange the Arduino pro micro)
  - fit code to keyboard
  - added display functionallity without wlan first
  - functionallity of keyboard in bios (without os)
  - add layer toggle button
  - write data to file and read out (functions like runtime all,...) - runtime implemented
    

## Next Steps
  - test till nothing moves anymore
  - complete wiring plan
  - add complications to display (weather, status keyboard,...)
  - add website to rp2040w to change/show settings
  - cleanup lasercut files
  - add 3 Layer
  - display menu (perhaps over website,...)
  - hybernation/energy savings of  the controller and power
  - write read out data expansion (keycounter, settings,...)
