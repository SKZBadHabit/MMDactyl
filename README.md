###

Adding a plan for cabeling and set up

## Coding

Code under development - test of components, like layers and other movements (mouse,...)

### Status of code

it is currently under development but fully functional V3.02 contains layer 1 and 2 and basic functionallity of the display, without bios support and without hibernation


## Lasercut

Files for lasering flatpack of Dactyl, fully functioning files but not pretty for now


## Done Steps

  - implement to one of the already existing keyboards (exchange the Arduino pro micro)
  - fit code to keyboard
  - added display functionallity without wlan first
    

## Next Steps
  - test till nothing moves anymore
  - add complications to display (weather, status keyboard,...)
  - add website to rp2040w to change/show settings
  - cleanup lasercut files
  - functionallity of keyboard in bios (without os)
  - add 3 Layer and layer toggle button
  - display menu (perhaps over website,...)
  - hybernation of  the controller and power
  - write data to file and read out (functions like runtime all,...)
